<h2>
  Quota for oTree projects
</h2>
<p>
  A simple quota for oTree projects. Counts the number of completions and directs subjects to another page when the desired number of completions has been reached. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>Please note that subjects are able to start and finish the project until other subjects' simultaneous participations are completed!</b> If you wish to count how many subjects start the project instead of the number of completions, you may put the counter (incremented on MyPage4) in an earlier page.
